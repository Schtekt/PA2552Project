This document gives suggestions in what manner the c++ code should be written for this project.
It may be updated at any time of the running project and should in no way be seen as rulings, mere suggestions
to keep the code consistent.

Classes:
	* Each class should be contained within a .h file and a .cpp file whenever possible.
	
	* Each .h file should be enclosed within #ifndef, #define and #endif. See example below.
		// for a class foo in foo.h
		#ifndef FOO_H
		#define FOO_H
	
		class foo
		{
			// declarations and stuff...
		}
		#endif

	* Each private member variable should start their names with "m_" to note that they are members.
	  See example below.
		// for a member variable size in class foo

		#ifndef FOO_H
		#define FOO_H
	
		class foo
		{
			private:
				int m_size;
		}
		#endif

	* All names of variables and functions should be camelcased. Public functions of classes starting wtih a capital letter.
	  See example below.
		// for a class foo in foo.h
		#ifndef FOO_H
		#define FOO_H
	
		class foo
		{
			private:
				int m_size;
				int m_bigSize;
			public:
				int GetSize() const;
		}
		#endif
